It writes what the data shows, what may explain it, and what to do next, citing the numbers it used. It works only from that client's data, and nothing reaches a client until you've reviewed it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which data sources can I connect?",
    a: "Google Ads, Google Local Services Ads, Meta Ads, Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, keyword rank tracking (with your DataForSEO account) and CallRail. Some Google and Meta connections are still completing those platforms' app reviews, so we set them up with you during early access. Microsoft Advertising is next.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fresh is the data?",
    a: "Marketing Nexus checks every connected source every hour, and keyword positions update daily. Google and Meta can take a day or two to finish counting recent conversions, so the most recent days are marked as still counting.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it change anything in my accounts?",
    a: "No. Marketing Nexus only reads reporting data. It never creates, changes or pauses campaigns, ads, budgets or website settings, and you can disconnect any source at any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does budget pacing work?",
    a: "Set each client's monthly budget once; it repeats every month. Marketing Nexus compares spend with budget every hour, forecasts where the month will land, shows the daily spend that lands on budget, and alerts you when a client drifts over or under.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my clients see their results?",
    a: "Yes. Send branded reports weekly or monthly by private link or PDF, or give each client a login to their own dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after I enter my email?",
    a: "We email you an invitation to book a setup call. On the call we connect your first client's ad accounts, Google Analytics, Search Console and rankings together, so you start with your own data. There's nothing to install and no card to enter.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost?",
