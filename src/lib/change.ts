// Changes against the comparison period, in words. One rule set for KPI

//
//   - Spend and other "neutral" metrics never get a verdict: spending more is
//     neither good nor bad on its own.
//   - A change smaller than MIN_CHANGE_PCT reads "about the same" (normal
//     variation), whatever its direction.
//   - Counts (clicks, leads…) and figures built on results (cost per lead,
//     conversion rate…) read "too few to compare" when either period has fewer
//     than MIN_SAMPLE of what they count.
//   - While platforms are still counting recent results (see `stillCounting`
//     in ./results.ts), result metrics get no verdict ("still counting").
