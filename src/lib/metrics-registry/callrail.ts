// CallRail call-tracking metrics. Stored daily per CallRail company, bucketed
// by the company's time zone (src/server/data-sources/callrail/metrics.ts).
// Covers what agency reporting tools (e.g. AgencyAnalytics) show for CallRail:
// calls, answered/missed, voicemails, first-time callers, durations, leads,
// value, forms, and calls by source, medium, campaign, keyword, landing page,
// caller city, tag, weekday and hour. Individual calls (the call log) live in
// CallRecord.
